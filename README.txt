This project is totally my own work, i used some process i learned last year in my french IT school, to do the project. Indeed i have already work on a Video Game project in C#, with a library called XNA which simplify a lot of process, that’s why i tried to reproduce how work this library on my Flappy Bird project. So i made some functions to initialize, load, update and draw in each Class of my project, to simplify how the game work.

The graphics are also my own work, i made all the backgrounds, titles, pipes, Bird Sprites, effects, … with Adobe Photoshop and Pen tablet. Firstly i tried to do the original Flappy Bird universe, that’s why i reproduced the background, pipe, bird, ground and some others. That’s was i big part of my work because i sometimes had need to do it pixel by pixel with the original picture just beside.
After that, i would to be more fun with the graphical aspect, that’s why i drew two others map with my Pen Tablet. Finally i made a Map menu to choose with which one the user want to play.
The Bird animation is a gif file i created with three sprites of a bird.
Notice that there is some scrolling effect on the menu, tutorial, and during the game. The menu i chose to drew cloud or star (according to the background chose by the user) in the sky, with a scrolling effect. In the Tutorial (just before the game start), i did the same with the sky but i also add i parallax scrolling for the ground, that’s continue during the game (as the original Flappy Bird).

The song part was make with AudioClip (interface in JAVA for playing a sound clip) because there were some problems with StdAudio. And moreover it’s simpler with this interface.
For the music i used some of famous retro song of The Legend of Zelda. The menu is Ocarina of Time: Fairy Navi (Found on Youtube) and the second one for the game is Ocarina of Time: Kokiri Forest (also found on Youtube). The game over song is a famous song of Super Mario Bros (found on http://www.lemondedemario.fr/bruitages/). When the bird pass thought a pipe i also used a song of Super Mario Bros (pieces song).
The other song are found on a free on librarie named http://www.sound-fishing.net/bruitages.html
